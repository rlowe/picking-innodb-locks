[PLDPC2016] Picking InnoDB Locks

Shared locks, exclusive locks, intention locks, gap locks, deadlocks,
and lock wait timeouts!  How does it really work under the hood?  And
how can we use this knowledge to make our environment better?  This
presentation will be a deep dive into InnoDB locking internals, which
will help attendees be able to make strategic technology decisions (i.e.
is InnoDB the right choice?).
